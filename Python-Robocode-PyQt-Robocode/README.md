### A Fork of Robocode for python programming

This is the new and maintained version developed with PyQt

### Need help to start? Check the [wiki](https://github.com/turkishviking/Python-Robocode/wiki)

Any help is welcome! This is a beta version, tell me if you notice any bugs

### If you want to contribute, I do not have the time yet for developing some base robot( wall runner, coins camper, random move etc...). If you do this, I will be happy to include it into the source code. (Post an issue or make a pull request in this case).
